            <h4>Welcome to my portfolio!
                I'm a tech enthusiast with a passion for building innovative and user-friendly products. I'm excited to share my journey with you, from my first steps in coding to my latest projects.                
                In this portfolio, you'll find a showcase of my work in a variety of areas, including Front-end development, Back-end development and Full-Stack. I've worked on a range of projects, from small personal websites to larger projects with peers from my previous web development Bootcamp.                
                I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow.

                    Mokepon is a project that showcases my newly acquired skills on Javascript coding for creating a simple yet fun clone of the popular game franchise Pokemon, in this game you can play against an AI or even play multiplayer with a friend thanks to the 
                implementation of Firebase for seamless integration of  real-time NoSQL database that allows for efficient data sharing and updates without the need for explicit polling. This ensures that all players are always up-to-date with the latest game state, including player movements, battle actions, and in-game events.</h4>                   
                <h4>Mokepon's extensive use of JavaScript for DOM manipulation and sprite rendering enables efficient and responsive gameplay. JavaScript provides direct access to the browser's Document Object Model, enabling immediate and seamless updates to the displayed graphics and interactions.
                This eliminates the need for intermediary libraries or frameworks, minimizing the overhead and enhancing overall performance. By utilizing JavaScript directly, Mopekon delivers a smooth and responsive gaming experience across a wide range of devices, including mobile.

                <h4> 
                    Fit-Squad is a web app that connects users who want to get fitter whilst also making new connections to a community of like-minded people. It hosts events organized by groups of all sorts of sports, which users can join to be notified for upcoming events. There is also an AI model implemented where users can specify their fitness goals and it will give them quick home workouts to do at home to get fitter between events when they are in a pinch for time.              
                    Fit-Squad was made with Ruby on Rails, a full-stack web application framework that uses the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture , PostgreSQL for the database and both Mapbox API and OpenAI API for better search journey and custom workouts. This makes for a well-structured and maintainable codebase, which is important for a project of this size and complexity.</h4>                   
                <h4>The Fit-Squad app has a number of features that make it stand out from other fitness apps. First, it has a strong focus on community and social interaction. Users can connect with each other, join groups, and participate in events. This makes it easier for users to find others who share their fitness goals and interests, and it also helps to create a more supportive and motivating environment.                    
                    Second, the Fit-Squad app uses AI to provide users with personalized workout recommendations. This is a great feature for users who are new to fitness or who don't have the time to create their own workouts.

                    Sea&B was made by cloning the complex schema and database layout of AirBnB using Ruby on Rails with the MVC model (Model-View-Controller), PostgreSQL for the database and Mapbox API for a map search function.
                    The web app in question takes the very succesful idea of AirBnB but is used for luxury yachts instead, where users can look for yachts to rent when on holiday or owners can advertise their own when not in use for some extra income. </h4>
                <h4>The app has a number of features that make it stand out from other yacht rental websites. First, it has a user-friendly interface that makes it easy to browse and book yachts. Second, it offers a wide range of yachts to choose from, including sailboats, motor yachts, and catamarans. Third, it allows users to filter their search results by price, location, and other criteria.
                    Sea&B is a well-designed and innovative app that offers a number of unique features. It is a great option for users who are looking to rent or advertise luxury yachts.
